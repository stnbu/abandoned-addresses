    <h2>Abandoned-Addresses WASM</h2>
    <p>This is a Rust-WASM implementation of the abandoned-addresses web3 API for use in place of etheres.js</p>
    <p>This page will likely go away and is only useful for the first stages of bootstrapping.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>This crate has experimental support for <code>externref</code>. It appears to work in the latest Firefox but may not work in you browser.</p>
    <p>If you see "Hello abandoned-addresses!" printed below, your browser supports WASM.</p>
    <p>If not, you might look at the browser's JavaScript console for errors. Not supporting <code>externref</code> is not a big deal. If you would like to work on this project, you only need install the latest Firefox browser to load and run the resulting WASM.</p>
