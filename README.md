Ohh, Look at me! I have "_ideeeeas_".

Here's the kernel of the idea:

> Blacklist.sol -- A contract, that's as simple as possible, that stores blacklisted "things" (probably addresses). Obvious contract code, addoption be 100% up to network effect. "Which blacklist do you use?" The idea is that people will voulentarally add <em>their own</em> controlled addresses to help filter some noise. Or are worried about the wallet's security (misplaced hardware wallet? compromised software wallet?). Yes, you can just stop using it, empty it out and everything, but people are going to go on beliving this key is <em>you</em>, even though you've lost control of it. You want to blacklist it. Afterall, you can't blacklist someone else's address. You need to be able to proove you (currently) own it.
